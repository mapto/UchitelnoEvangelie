	abstract = {In the design of the specialised software for production of bilingual word indices 
            to Constantine of Preslav’s Didactic Gospel, we faced two major challenges. One, common 
            to such texts, is the lexico-grammatical asymmetry between the language of the source 
            and that of the target of the translation. The other, specific to the current work, has 
            to do with the sources and editions of the texts in both languages. At the beginning of 
            this article, we briefly present the key circumstances that, on the one hand, define the 
            lexicographical concept of the word indices, and on the other hand, further shape the 
            technological solutions for their production. Here we focus on the functionalities of 
            the proposed solution and how they fit into the overall dictionary development process. 
            The process features 8 steps, three of which are automated with purpose-built software, 
            namely: preparation for parallelisation and lemmatisation, integration of intermediate 
            results, and index generation. We provide specific examples to illustrate solutions to 
            lexicographic problems that are common to bilingual dictionaries (e.g., linguistic 
            asymmetry between source and target texts) or specific to the work (e.g., variability in 
            sources). The used approach allows the software tools to be used for the production of 
            other bilingual dictionaries after a corresponding configuration.},
